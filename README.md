# Custom Tetris+
This game was overlooking _a lot_ of major problems, so I decided to make a custom version of Custom Tetris! Credits to Ondras for the original version.

## Why?
The very last commit made to the original version was in **2015**, and that was just for adding a licence. The last commit that actually changed code was in **2013**, so it was starting to get very out of date quickly. In order to "resurrect" the project, I forked it. And that's the story of "Custom Tetris+"

## How do I run this?
For a start, since it's **not** hosted through Github Pages, you have to clone it using git!
`git clone https://github.com/UniqueName12345/custom-tetris-plus`

Then, you simply go in the directory and launch the `index.html` file in your favourite browser!

- UniqueName12345, aka me, for nessecary changes
_Contribute to get **your** name added to the list!_
